This project demonstrates decentralized learning using JavaScript, PeerJS, and ONNX Runtime. Each node trains a local model and exchanges weights with peers for collaborative learning.

1. Install the dependencies
npm install

2. Run the server 
node signaling_server.js

3. Open client.html
http-server

4. Simulate multiple nodes
Open client.html in multiple tabs to simulate peer-to-peer decentralized learning.
